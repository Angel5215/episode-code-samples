> Let’s apply the Composable Architecture’s new state sharing tools to something even more real world: our open source word game, [isowords](https://github.com/pointfreeco/isowords). It currently models its user settings as a cumbersome dependency that requires a lot of code to keep features in sync when settings change. We should be able to greatly simplify things with the `@Shared` property wrapper.

The code sample from this episode is available [here](https://github.com/pointfreeco/isowords/commit/0d6af85194a3566f88da0ebeedc36cce370ab234).
