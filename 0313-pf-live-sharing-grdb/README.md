> We celebrate 7 years with a live stream! We discuss some recent updates around our popular [Sharing](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing) library; open source [SharingGRDB](http://github.com/pointfreeco/sharing-grdb) live, which is a new lightweight alternative to SwiftData that is powered by Sharing and [GRDB](http://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift); and we give a sneak peek of an upcoming series and library.

This week's episode was a live stream giving a tour of the above code bases. There is no episode-specific code sample.
