> We conclude the series by stretching our use of the `@Shared` property wrapper in [isowords](https://github.com/pointfreeco/isowords) to two more features: saved games and user defaults. In the process weâ€™ll eliminate hundreds of lines of boilerplate and some truly gnarly code.

The code sample from this episode is available [here](https://github.com/pointfreeco/isowords/commit/727e03fd24ab3265c3e80756841c451366508247).
