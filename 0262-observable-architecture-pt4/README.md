> Weâ€™ve made structs and optionals observable in the Composable Architecture, eliminating the need for `ViewStore`s and `IfLetStore`s, so what about enums? If we can make enums observable, we could further eliminate the concept of the `SwitchStore`, greatly improving the ergonomics of working with enums in the library.
