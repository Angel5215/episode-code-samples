> To celebrate our 6th anniversary we had another livestream! We updated an app from the most recent Composable Architecture tour to the latest observation tools, showed how these tools can improve UIKit-based apps, showed off some recent enhancements to the @Reducer macro, gave a sneak peek of a highly anticipated topic, and answered your questions along the way.

The source code in this episode reflects the updated source code of the Composable Architecture repo.
